# Algorithm-Lab

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation about algorithm created by Chao Xu, in which the problem of subset can be solved in $O(\sqrt{n}t)$. In this project, we implement the algorithm in C++ and support some test cases. We use this program as a major assignment for algorithm design and analysis of TJU.

## Config

```
g++
mingw32-make.exe
```

## Usage

In this project, we provide a makefile to help you to run this program easily. 

First, you need clone this project in your computer.

```
git clone git@github.com:KuangjuX/Algorithm-Lab.git Subset
cd Subset/src
```

Now you are in the folder of source code.  You can compile and run by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```
mingw32-make
mingw-32-make run
```
